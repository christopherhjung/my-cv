    summary: |
        Compilers are intriguing to me because they act as the translators between human creativity and machine precision, transforming our abstract code into executable reality.
        
        Their ability to optimize and refine code offers interresting challenges that I am eager to solve.
        
        Exploring compilers reveals a world where logical rigor meets creative problem-solving, sparking my fascination.
        
        This fascination has driven me to delve deeply into compiler design and optimization techniques, constantly seeking to enhance my understanding and skills in this field not only on the job but also as a hobby.
        
        Currently I work on writing my own programming language using LLVM to get a deeper understanding of all the aspects compilers are made of.
